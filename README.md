# Disease-Prediction-Analysis
Breakdown of My Disease Prediction Analysis project:

1. Introduction:
   - The Disease Prediction Analysis project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict diseases based on medical data from two separate datasets.
   - The project aims to develop predictive models that can assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing and predicting diseases accurately.

2. Data Collection and Preparation:
   - Two separate datasets are used for analysis: one containing 2351 samples and the other containing 486 samples.
   - The datasets are concatenated along the rows to create a single dataset for analysis, resulting in a total of 2837 samples.
   - Missing values in the concatenated dataset are handled using appropriate techniques such as imputation or removal.
   
3. Feature Engineering:
   - Relevant features from both datasets are selected or engineered to improve the predictive performance of the models.
   - Feature encoding techniques such as label encoding or one-hot encoding are applied to handle categorical variables.
  
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques are used to gain insights into the distribution and relationships among variables in the concatenated dataset.
   - EDA helps identify patterns, correlations, and potential predictors of diseases within the combined dataset.
   - Specific feature distributions and relationships with the target variable are explored to understand their predictive value.

5. Model Selection and Training:
   - Several classification algorithms are considered for disease prediction, including XGBoost, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes.
   - The concatenated dataset is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split()` function, ensuring that both datasets contribute to both sets.
   - Each algorithm is trained on the training set and evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

6. Model Evaluation and Performance:
   - The trained models are evaluated on the testing set to assess their predictive performance.
   - Performance metrics are computed for each model to measure its accuracy and effectiveness in disease prediction.
   - Feature importance analysis is conducted to identify the most influential features in predicting diseases.

7. Conclusion:
   - The Disease Prediction Analysis project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning techniques for disease prediction based on medical data from different sources.
   - By leveraging predictive models trained on concatenated datasets and incorporating additional relevant features, healthcare professionals can potentially improve patient outcomes and optimize treatment strategies.
   - Further research and refinement of the models may be necessary to account for differences in sample sizes and ensure robust performance across diverse datasets.
